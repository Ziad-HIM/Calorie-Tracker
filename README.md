# Calorie Counter: Your Diet's Best Friend (or Worst Enemy) ðŸ˜ˆ

## Tired of eating too much (or too little)? 

Bulking? Track your gains and see how much you have left for your goal!
Cutting? Keep an eye on those macros and make sure you're not starving yourself!

How to do it:

- Set your calorie goal. (Be honest, you know you want to go over.)

- Add your meals. Don't forget the snacks!

- Watch the magic happen. 

Note: AI (ChatGPT) was consulted for assistance in the JavaScript aspect of this project, but no code was directly copy-pasted. The comments seen throughout the code are automatically generated by a feature in Replit (they suggest comments, and I can click enter to keep them). All work in this project is original, motivated by a desire to create a simple calorie tracker app for myself and others.
